## 🎮 Gameplay
**The Forge** is a digital card game featuring two main phases: **Draft** and **Action**.

### Draft Phase
Players begin by drafting their characters. Random rows of cards—**item, talent, ability, and clothes**—are laid out along with a random situation. Players take turns picking one card per row to create a character that best completes the situation.  

- Choosing a card forces your opponent to take the remaining card of the same type in that row.  
- In the first Draft Phase, all cards must be drafted to move on.  
- In subsequent Draft Phases, players may end early, letting both players draw one final card before proceeding.

### Action Phase
Once drafted, characters are brought to life using images generated by **Decart**, and four actions (linked to their drafted cards) become available.  

- Players choose actions in turn; selecting an action blocks the opponent from using the same type.  
- Once all actions are used, an **LLM evaluates the story** created by both players’ moves and determines the winner.  

This phase flips Draft logic on its head: while strong cards may force weak cards onto opponents in Draft, using them early in Action may free opponents from constraints, creating unexpected chaos.

### Rounds & Scoring
The Draft+Action cycle repeats for **3 rounds**. At the end of the game, players are awarded titles by an LLM based on:  
- Best overall performance across situations  
- Best play of the game
